##Greet
The greet.js module has an airty of 1.  The valid input is a string.  The output is a concatenated string of "Hello (input string)".  If the input is not a string, the output is null.

The output for add is a number which is the sum of the two input numbers.  The output for sub is a number which is the difference between the two input numbers.  If the input is not valid (not two numbers), the output is null.
